## Summer Camp - June 21st - July 23rd, 2021
The camp will consist of 5 weeks of training that lead into the school year and help to prepare our team for a successful season. Please reach out to [Coach Nick](mailto:ngraffis@hbuhsd.edu) with questions. üíö

The team will take a break from July 26th - August 16th (for the boys), and July 26th - the start of school (for the girls). This is a great time to plan vacations, as there will not be training.
