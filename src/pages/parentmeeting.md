# The Class & Expectations

You are required to attend all practices and games, and will be dropped from the class if you are inable to do this. If it is too late in the semester to drop you from the class, you will be dropped from team activities, but will still be required to attend your PE class with Coach Whittmore. And your grade will reflect your absences. 

If you are not enrolled in the class, and your attendance becomes an issue, you will be asked to leave the team. 

If you have issues and cannot attend games and/or practices. Athltes need to communicate that well in advanced, and at the end of the day, we have to mark you absent for days that your are absent. The attendance department can handle issues you may have.

As a team, we need you here, and can plan in advance to handle rare issues that arrise, but as far as the class goes, it is not up to us and you will need to contact the attendance department. 

# Teams & Competition

We will break into teams, both for practice and for games. These groups will change early in the season, until they are closer the set as the season ends.

Frosh/Soph - Frosh/Soph is for Freshman and Sophomores, and it will sometimes be used for younger athletes with less experience, and sometimes be used for athletes with more experience.

JV - JV will sometimes be for athletes with less experience, but will also often be used for athletes that do not play in a Varsity game, but might have been on the bench during that game. 

Varsity - Highest level

## How can I know what team to go watch?

This can be difficult, but in order to allow for athletes to attend the most games and the best opportunites, things will change based on athltees performance, CIF rules, league rules, and communication with opposing coaches and tournament directors.

## Communication about team placement and playtime

Athletes need to communicate with the coaching staff about their team placement and their playtime.

# Communication other than team placement and playtime

1. Athlete's should communicate with their coach.
2. If that does not resolve an issue, Parents can contact me and set up a meeting to communicate about an issue. To allow for the best communication, please send respectful emails, and also please explain the issue so that I can be prepared and gather the information that is needed to best meet with you. 
3. If that does not resolve an issue, you may contact the Athletic Director.
4. If that does not resolve an issue, you may contact the Vice Principal in charge of Athletics. 
5. If that does not resolve an issue, you may contact the Principal.
6. If that does not resolve an issue, you may contact the District Office.

# Transportation 

In general, there is transportation to games via a school bus on school days and not on non school days. 

# Help

If we could have someone to help to record games and post them to Hudl, that would be extreamly helpful. 

# Hudl & Zoom

We will use Hudl to record games, and analyze film. And we will sometimes have Zoom Meetings to discuss film, espceially as we get deeper into the season.

# Post Season

When the season is over you will need to attend your PE class with coach Whittmore. We will continue weight training and it is likely that you will not have to attend that PE class on days we lift weights.

If you play on a water polo club team, you will need to attend your PE class on those days, unless we have weights.

At the end of the day, once season is over, Coach Whittmore is the teacher in charge of the class.

# Spring Semester

In the spring you can join the Swim Team. If you chose not to do that, you will need to find another PE class, because there is no _water polo_ class in the Spring.

If you do not need a PE class, your counselor will let you know.
