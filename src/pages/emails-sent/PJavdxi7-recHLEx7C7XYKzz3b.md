## Email List & Communication

I have cleaned up the email list a significant amount, this email was sent to the following addresses:

**Athlete Emails**: hey@nickgraffis.me


If you would like to add, remove, or update an email from an "_Athlete_" to a _"Parent"_ email, you can do so [here](https://edisonwp.com/email-list/recHLEx7C7XYKzz3b).

## Athlete Clearance

Athletes will need to be cleard by **August 24th** or they will not be able to participate in games, scrimmages, or practice. Not being cleared will result in an unescused abscense. 

### Steps for Clearance

✅ Register on [Home Campus](https://www.homecampus.com). _You are signed up on Home Campus_.

Sign up online [here](https://www.homecampus.com) and then verify your email. Then fill out all of the necessisary forms. 

❌ Provide the school with a current physical. _You do not have a current physical on file with the school_.

❌ Take the online Concussion Baseline Test. If you have signed up on Home Campus, our athlete dirictor has already sent you a link to take the test. If you need to get that link again, email [Rich Boyce](mailto:rboyce@hbuhsd.edu).

❌ Provide the school's financial office with a check made out to **Edison High School** for **$90.00** anytime **_between 12PM and 3 PM_**  for _"Training & Transportation Fees"_. Training refers to the schools trainer, not Coach Ashley, and transportation refers to our use of school busses and vans. 

**❌ You are not currently cleared.**

## Game Schedule

The [Game Schedule](https://edisonwp.com/boys) has not changed significantly since it was posted months ago. You can view it [here](https://edisonwp.com/boys).
