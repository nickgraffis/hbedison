_I did notice that some people had Physicals listed on Home Campus, and then those physicals were removed. I will follow up with the AD Monday for those individuals, but please also follow up with [Rich Boyce](mailto:rboyce@hbuhsd.edu) if you feel you have a physical on file, but this email says you do not._
