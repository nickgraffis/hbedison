Hey {{ context.Name }},

The boys water polo season will officially begin on August 22nd. Here are some really important things to know and do before we get started. **We will also have a Parent Meeting August 23rd at 7 PM at the Edison HS Library**. 

Take a look at some important information below for this season. Or [view this email in the browser](https://edisonwp.com/emails/preseason?{{ Object.keys(context)?.map(key => `${key}=${context[key]}`).join('&') }})

## Email List & Communication

I have cleaned up the email list a significant amount, this email was sent to the following addresses:

**Athlete Emails**: {{ context.AthleteEmails }}
{{ context?.ParentEmails ? '**ParentEmails:** ' + context.ParentEmails : '' }}

If you would like to add, remove, or update an email from an "_Athlete_" to a _"Parent"_ email, you can do so [here](https://edisonwp.com/email-list/{{ context.id }}).

## Athlete Clearance

Athletes will need to be cleard by **August 24th** or they will not be able to participate in games, scrimmages, or practice. Not being cleared will result in an unescused abscense. 

### Steps for Clearance

{{ context?.HomeCampus ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå' }} Register on [Home Campus](). _You {{  context?.HomeCampus ? 'are' : ' are not'}} signed up on Home Campus_.

Sign up online [here]() and then verify your email. Then fill out all of the necessisary forms. 

{{ context?.Physical ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå' }} Provide the school with a current physical. _You {{ context?.Physical ? 'have a current physical on file with the school' : 'do not have a current physical on file with the school' }}_.

{{ context?.Cleared ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå' }} Take the online Concussion Baseline Test. If you have signed up on Home Campus, our athlete dirictor has already sent you a link to take the test. If you need to get that link again, email [Rich Boyce](mailto:rboyce@hbuhsd.edu).

{{ context?.Cleared ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå' }} Provide the school's financial office with a check made out to **Edison High School** for **$90.00** **_anytime between 12PM and 3 PM_**  for _"Training & Transportation Fees"_. Training refers to the schools trainer, not Coach Ashley, and transportation refers to our use of school busses and vans. 

**{{ context?.Cleared ? 'üéâ You are currently cleared' : '‚ùå You are not currently cleared' }}.**
