Hey {{ context.Name }} and Family,

I'm working hard to make sure the email list is extreamly clean and accurate. Here is who I sent this email to: {{ context.AthleteEmails }}.

If there are additional emails you want to add to the list, please email me at [ngraffis@hbuhsd.edu](mailto:ngraffis@hbuhsd.edu) and we can add them.

The season is beginning next Monday, August 22nd. 

The first thing we all need to do is **finish our clearance process**.

## Clearance Process
1. Head to [homcampus](https://www.homecampus.com).com you can start the process by:
  * Signing up for an account
  * Verifying your email address
  * Filling out the neccessary forms

You are currently {{ context.HomeCampus ? '**signed up**' : '**not signed up**' }} for HomeCampus.

2. Make sure that you have a current physcial on file with the school. If you gave me one over the summer, the school now has it. 

Your physical is {{ context.Physical ? '**current**' : '**not current**' }}.

3. Check your email, if you signed up on Home Campus, you got an email from our Athletic Director to take your online concussion test.

4. Go to the school's financial office anytime between 12 and 3 PM and give them a check, made out to _"Edison High School"_ for _"$90"_. This fee is for _"Training and Transportation"_ - Training refers not to coach Ashley, but the school's trainer. Transportation refers to busses and vans that we will take throughout the year.
